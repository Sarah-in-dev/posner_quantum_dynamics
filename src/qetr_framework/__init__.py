QETR Framework
==============

Quantum Eligibility Trace Reinforcement Learning

A framework demonstrating that physics-derived eligibility traces
from nuclear spin coherence solve temporal credit assignment
where classical mechanisms fail.

Key components:
- quantum_eligibility: Physics of nuclear spin coherence
- agents: RL agents using quantum eligibility traces
- environments: Benchmark tasks for temporal credit assignment
- experiments: Validation experiments
