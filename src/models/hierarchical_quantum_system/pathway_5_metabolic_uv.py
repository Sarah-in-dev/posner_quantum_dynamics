PATHWAY 5: METABOLIC ACTIVITY → UV PHOTON GENERATION

Activity-dependent UV photon emission from mitochondrial metabolism provides
the energy source for tryptophan excitation and superradiance.

BIOLOGICAL MECHANISM:
--------------------
Neural activity creates energy demand. Mitochondria respond by increasing ATP
production through oxidative phosphorylation. This accelerated metabolism has
an often-overlooked byproduct: UV photon emission.

The mechanism:
1. **Increased electron transport** (Complex I-IV activity)
2. **ROS production** (superoxide O₂⁻, hydrogen peroxide H₂O₂)
3. **Biomolecule oxidation** (lipids, proteins become excited states)
4. **Photon emission** (excited states decay → UV photons)

The emission spectrum spans 200-400 nm, with particular intensity in the
250-350 nm range. Critically, the peak at 280 nm EXACTLY MATCHES the
absorption peak of tryptophan. This spectral overlap is not coincidental but
suggests an evolved coupling between metabolic activity and protein
photochemistry.

ACTIVITY DEPENDENCE:
-------------------
At baseline (resting metabolism): ~1000 photons/s per synapse
During intense activity (plasticity): ~50,000 photons/s per synapse (50x)

This enhancement is proportional to:
- ATP consumption rate
- Calcium influx (drives mitochondrial activity)
- NMDA receptor activation

**This is why quantum learning requires metabolic activity.**

SPATIAL LOCALIZATION:
--------------------
Mitochondria are not randomly distributed. They cluster at:
- Active synapses (high energy demand)
- Near postsynaptic density (where quantum processing occurs)
- At dendritic branch points

This spatial organization ensures UV photons are delivered where tryptophan
networks (Pathway 3) are located - at the PSD during plasticity.

SPECTRAL OVERLAP WITH TRYPTOPHAN:
---------------------------------
The emission spectrum of metabolic photons overlaps ~60% with tryptophan
absorption. This means:
- 280 nm photons from metabolism are efficiently absorbed by tryptophan
- Other wavelengths (250-270 nm, 300-350 nm) less efficiently absorbed
- Net effect: metabolic activity directly excites tryptophan networks

**This is the energy source for Pathway 6 (tryptophan superradiance).**

EXPERIMENTAL PREDICTIONS:
------------------------
1. Block metabolism (oligomycin, rotenone) → reduced UV → reduced learning
2. Enhance metabolism (mild uncoupling) → increased UV → enhanced learning
3. Measure UV emission during plasticity (should increase 10-100x)
4. Dark vs. light: Baseline UV still present (endogenous)

KEY INNOVATIONS:
---------------
1. **Activity-dependent modulation**: Links metabolism to quantum layer
2. **Spatial organization**: Mitochondria cluster at active synapses
3. **Spectral matching**: 280 nm peak overlaps tryptophan absorption
4. **Quantitative predictions**: Photon flux vs. ATP consumption
