# Lead: po2-phosphate (PO-2 · the phosphate loop) — OWNED BY THIS PO

**Objective (the done-bar, a MEASUREMENT):** total phosphate conserved around a full
hydrolysis → consumption → dissolution → recovery cycle to a **stated** tolerance, with the
check **shown failing on current code first**; and J-coupling demonstrably tracking dimer
consumption.

**Status:** DISPATCHED by the MO 2026-07-18 19:05Z — chip `task_e54e9c25` pending.
**Current unit:** — (first act is the `### GROUNDING BRIEF`)
**Last heartbeat:** —
**Blocked on:** —

**Why now:** PO-1's B2 landed and is MO-verified; the tree is clean, so the `model6_core.py`
shared-file boundary the board gated PO-2 on is met.

**Two defects, kept separate:**
- `phosphate_total` stale (`atp_system.py:428` recomputes only inside `add_phosphate_from_atp`;
  `model6_core.py:450-452` decrements `phosphate_structural` without it) ⇒ J-coupling
  (`atp_system.py:485`) reads a field ignoring dimer consumption. **Contained bug.**
- **ATP↔Pi not mass-conserving** — hydrolysis credits Pi (`:130`), recovery regenerates ATP
  (`:163`, `:169-170`) without debiting any pool. **This breaks Step E: the finite pool is not
  finite around the loop, the reset feedback does not close, and the SOC engine does not exist.**

**Owns:** `atp_system.py`, the phosphate path in `model6_core.py`.
**Must not touch:** PO-1's `vibrational_cascade_module.py` + backbone params (PO-1 owes a D/φ
item) · PO-3's `spine_plasticity_module.py` · PO-4's `analytical_gap` in BOTH drivers and
`run_theta_burst_45s.py` (actively consolidating) · PO-5's `multi_synapse_network.py` + T1′
family · PO-6's surfaces.

**Shared-file hazard:** `model6_core.py` — PO-1/PO-4/PO-2. One uncommitted holder at a time.
Commit at the boundary; a broken shared tree blocked two POs earlier today.

**NOT this PO's to decide:** `K_CLASSICAL` — MO-held, decision-ready with Sarah. `0.005` is live
and correct in `ca_triphosphate_complex.py:160`; `analytical_gap` still runs the retired `0.05`.
Report, do not touch.

**Gates:** PO-6 (HARD). The drive×damping sweep measures nothing against a non-conserving loop.

**Prior art:** `sweep/phosphate_conservation_probe.py` (repo root) already exists and already
uses the correct `K_CLASSICAL = 0.005` with its citation. Extend it; do not rebuild.
